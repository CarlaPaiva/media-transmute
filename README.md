# MediaTransmute

MediaTransmute is a online file converter.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project was simple: I use a lot media/file converter tools on my daily job. One thing that always use to bother me is that the online existent tools always had some limitation: only a few files per time, daily limit, etc. Paying for a premium subscription of theses tools were not a plan for me, so I decided to use this situation as a change to learn and create my own file converter.
